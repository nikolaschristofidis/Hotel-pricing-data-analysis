# Hotel Pricing Data Analysis – Cyprus

Academic data analysis project exploring the key factors affecting hotel room prices in Cyprus.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze which factors have a significant impact on hotel room pricing and to build a statistical model that explains price variation.

## Data
- 126 hotels
- 5 cities in Cyprus
- Data collected from Booking.com (July 2025)

## Methodology
- Descriptive statistics

- Log transformation to address price skewness
- Linear and multiple regression analysis
- Dummy variables for categorical features

## Key Findings
- Hotel stars and customer review scores are strong drivers of price
- Room type and room size significantly affect pricing
- Location and city influence price differences across regions
- Final regression model explains approximately 84% of price variation (R² ≈ 0.84)

## Output
- Full academic report (Greek)
- Project presentation slides

## Notes
This project focuses on analytical thinking and statistical reasoning rather than programming.
